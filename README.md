# README

## This is a code for finding the time length of simple pendulum (Remote triggered Lab).

## The components those are coded are:
1. Ultrasonic Sensor 
2. IR sensor
3. Servo Motor
4. Stepper motor

## The user will have to first upload the code in Arduino and then give the input 1 in the serial monitor when promted. This will first take the reading of the length from the ultrasonic sensor.
## After that the servo motor will give an impulse or intial jerk to the bob and the ir sensor will calculate the times at which it pases the mean position and then we will get the average time period.
## From the values of time and length we can find the value of the gravitaional conatant g.
